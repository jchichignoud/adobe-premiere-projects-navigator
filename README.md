### INSTRUCTIONS
- use "refresh" button to get up-to-date list of currently open projects
- click the X to save and close a project

### RECENT FIXES
- extension now checks it's closing the right file based on filepath rather than an id (avoids issues when projects list hasn't been refreshed before using it to close a project)

### KNOWN ISSUES
- Close All and Save All buttons are not functional yet
